\section{The structure sheaf}

Consider the simplest case of an implicit atlas $\cA$ with a single global chart, given by a smooth manifold $Y$, a smooth function $s: Y \to E$ into a finite dimensional vector space $E$, and the zero set $X = s^{-1}(0)$. Since the following diagram should be a pullback,
\[ \xymatrix{X \ar[r] \ar[d] & Y \ar[d]^-{s} \\ {*} \ar[r]_-{0} & E}\]
we would like to have that the $C^\oo$-ring $\cO(X)$ is the homotopy tensor product, $\cO(X) = \RR \tensor_{\cO(E)} \cO(Y)$.

\subsection{Simplicial sheaf of $n$-thickenings}

\begin{defn}
Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space. An {\bf $n$-thickening} is the data of a smooth manifold $Y$, together with vector spaces $E_1, \dots, E_n$ and maps $\sigma_i: Y \to E_i$, and a homeomorphism $\psi: X \to \sigma^{-1}(0)$, where $\sigma = \sigma_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus \sigma_n$.
\end{defn}

Now, suppose $(X, \cA)$ is an implicit manifold. \jake{[Details here to be worked out and clarified. In particular, need to explain what ``compatible with $\cA$" means, as well as addressing the fact that the zero sets $f_i^{-1}(0)$ won't be smooth manifolds. Proving the simplicial identities would be good too.]} There is a simplicial (pre?)sheaf $\cT \cH_\cA^\bullet$ on $X$, given by
\[ \cT \cH_\cA^n(U) = \left\{ \text{$n$-thickenings of $U$ compatible with $\cA$} \right\}. \]
The face maps are given by
\[ d_i : \left( Y, (E_1, \sigma_1, \dots, E_n, \sigma_n) \right) \mapsto \left( \sigma_i^{-1}(0), (E_1, \sigma_1, \dots, \wh E_i, \wh \sigma_i, \dots , E_n, \sigma_n) \right), \]
and the degeneracies are given by
\[ s_i : \left( Y, (E_1, \sigma_1, \dots, E_n, \sigma_n) \right) \mapsto \left( Y \times E_i, (E_1, \sigma_1, \dots, E_i, \sigma_i \circ \pi_1 - \pi_2, E_i, \pi_2, \dots, E_n, \sigma_n) \right). \]

We have the following candidate for the structure sheaf of $(X, \cA)$ as a derived manifold. Consider the simplicial sheaf $\cO_X^\bullet$ on $X$, given by
\[ \cO_X^n(U) = \coprod_{(Y, (E_i, \sigma_i)) \in \cT \cH_\cA^n(U)} C^\oo(Y). \]
\jake{[A slight modification of this should also give a notion of morphism spaces for implicit manifolds. For $X'$ another implicit manifold, simply replace $C^\oo(Y)$ above with $\Hom(Y, X')$; because $Y$ is a manifold, it already knows how to map into what is morally a limit of smooth manifolds.]}

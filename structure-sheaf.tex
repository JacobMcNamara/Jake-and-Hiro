\section{The structure sheaf}

Consider the simplest case of an implicit atlas $\cA$ with a single global chart, given by a smooth manifold $Y$, a smooth function $s: Y \to E$ into a finite dimensional vector space $E$, and the zero set $X = s^{-1}(0)$. Since the following diagram should be a pullback,
\[ \xymatrix{X \ar[r] \ar[d] & Y \ar[d]^-{s} \\ {*} \ar[r]_-{0} & E}\]
we would like to have that the $C^\oo$-ring $\cO(X)$ is the homotopy tensor product, $\cO(X) = \RR \tensor_{\cO(E)} \cO(Y)$.

\subsection{Simplicial sheaf of $n$-thickenings}

\begin{defn}
Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space. An {\bf $n$-thickening} is the data of a smooth manifold $Y$, together with vector spaces $E_1, \dots, E_n$ and maps $s_i: Y \to E_i$, and a homeomorphism $\psi: X \to s^{-1}(0)$, where $s = s_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus s_n$.
\end{defn}

Now, suppose $(X, \cA)$ is an implicit manifold. \jake{[Details here to be worked out and clarified.]} There is a simplicial (pre?)sheaf $\cT \cH_\cA^\bullet$ on $X$, given by
\[ \cT \cH_\cA^n(U) = \left\{ \text{$n$-thickenings of $U$ compatible with $\cA$} \right\}. \]
The face maps are given by replacing the thickening manifold $Y$ with $s_i^{-1}(0) \subset Y$ and forgetting $E_i$, while the degeneracies are given by replacing $Y$ with $Y \times E_i$, which contains two copies of $Y$ as the zero section and the graph of $s_i$.

\section{Notes from June 22}

Let $X \to S$ be a map of simplicial sets. Of course, it need not be a right fibration. Jake suspects that we can make the a replacement $X \to X' \to S$ where $X \to X$, while the map $X' \to S$ becomes a right fibration. He believes that this replacement is just a cospan construction, where objects are the same objects of $X$, and an edge from $A \to B$ is given by a cospan $A \to A' \leftarrow B$ where $A' \leftarrow B$ is an equivalence. The relevant section in HTT appears to be 5.1, and the proof of Proposition 5.1.1.1 there. It would be great to prove that this cospan construction for thickenings is just a general construction, and an explicit model of a fibrant replacement.
